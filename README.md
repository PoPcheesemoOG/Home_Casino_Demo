## Video Poker Project for CSCI 1175

### Intro:

I want to create a videopoker type game that is able to run multiple games online at once via multi-threading. The idea is that the player is able to run multiple different “slot machines” at once, as if you were at a Casino taking up an entire row of machines.

### Target Population:

The idea is that people who like the thrill of gambling and playing games of chance, but don’t want to risk their personal finances for the enjoyment. It will be appealing to the users for the realistic feeling of using an in-game currency that will not be limitless.

### Purpose:

The purpose is to create an exciting and enjoyable gambling experience without the real risk of ruin. The full releases of the program will include many different types of games and will save your progress so that you can keep going and show off to your friends how well or how poor you are doing. But for now, I will just make a small demo with one or two games to showcase the principle ideas.

Another benefit of this software is that you can play it while in the comfort of your own home. If someone has an itch to gamble a little bit, but don’t want to travel or risk any actual money, they can play this game.

### Constraints:

Players may encounter visual bugs, such as misaligned graphics, overlapping buttons, or display issues on various screen resolutions and sizes.

I will test the program with different settings to make sure that the program will adapt correctly.

Different devices with underpowered components as well might prove to “break” some of the GUI or logic.

I will test the program with different devices to make sure that the program will run correctly.

Network connectivity can also be problematic, the game might crash or not save the progress if the connection cuts out.

I might add an offline mode or a failsafe to save the data the second the network cuts out.

### Conclusion:

I am moving forward with this project to practice my skills at making gaming software and creating logic that is fun to use. I will start by making the game objects necessary, like the cards and the menu, and then to add them to the GUI.
